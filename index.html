    <h3>What can I find on this website?</h3>
    <p>This website focuses on CAN (Controller Area Network) and provides helpful tools and material.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="reg_eval/index.html">CAN Register Evaluator</a>:</strong> A tool that evaluates and finds
        errors in the configuration of the CAN module you use.

            <img src="/can/images/can_reg_eval1.png" alt="Screenshot of the CAN Register Evaluator tool"
              height="170px" />
          </a>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="xl_bt/index.html">CAN XL Bit Timing Calculator</a>:</strong> A tool that visually guides you
        when configuring CAN XL Bit Timing.

              height="170px" />
          </a>
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who is the target of this website?</h3>
    <p>This website is built for people that are facing CAN in a real project and struggle with its configuration. Such
      persons are</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Embedded software developers</strong> that directly interact with a CAN module (the piece of hardware
        on a microcontroller that implements the CAN communication).</li>
      <li><strong>System designers</strong> that need to decide which bit timing configuration to be used in their CAN
        networks</li>
      <li><strong>Anyone</strong>, who just wants to see some functional CAN bit timing configuration example</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why does this website exist?</h3>
    <p>I wanted to realize some complex project with help of AI (that I would have never started before AI was
      available). Further I wanted the result to be usefull for others.</p>

    <h3>Who is Arthur?</h3>
    <p>I'm an electrical engineer working at Bosch (Germany) and beeing in touch with CAN technology in my daily work
      since 15 years. I'm happy to share my knowledge with you.</p>
