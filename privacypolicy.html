    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated: <strong><span id="privacy-last-update">2025-12-28</span></strong></p>

    <h2>1. Controller</h2>
    <p>Arthur Mutter, Ziegelei 16, 73765 Neuhausen, Germany.<br>
    Email: <a href="mailto:arti.fun@gmx.de">arti.fun@gmx.de</a></p>

  <h2>2. Provision of the Website and Server Log Files</h2>
  <p>This static website is delivered via <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> (a service of GitHub Inc./GitHub B.V.). When you access the site, GitHub automatically processes technical access data: IP address (for delivery and security purposes), date/time, requested resource (URL/path), referrer (if sent by the browser), HTTP status code, data volume transferred, user agent (browser/OS), and any caching/security information.</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Technical delivery of pages, maintaining stability and security (misuse/attack detection), error diagnosis (no user-based profiling).<br>
  <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in secure and stable operation).<br>
  <strong>Storage duration:</strong> Raw log data are processed solely by GitHub according to its own deletion and retention policies and then deleted or anonymized. No separate permanent storage or merging with other data is carried out by me.<br>
  <strong>Recipient:</strong> GitHub Inc./GitHub B.V. as the hosting provider. Further details: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Contact via Email</h2>
    <p>If you contact me by email, your details (email address, message content, and, where applicable, name) are processed to handle your inquiry.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Responding to your request.<br>
    <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in communication); if pre-contractual inquiries were involved, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.<br>
    <strong>Storage duration:</strong> Deletion after final processing or in accordance with any statutory retention periods.</p>

  <h2>4. Anonymous Reach Measurement with GoatCounter</h2>
  <p>This website uses the open-source web analytics tool <strong>GoatCounter</strong> (instance: <code>watermelon.goatcounter.com</code>) for privacy-friendly, cookie-free reach measurement.</p>
  <p><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Page visited (path/URL), referrer (if transmitted), browser/device type (abstracted from user agent), language setting, date/time. IP addresses are only used in a form that does not allow conclusions about individuals (hash/shortened derivative to count unique visits).</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Statistical, non-personal evaluation to improve structure and content and to detect technical issues.</p>
  <p><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in anonymous reach analysis without tracking profiles). No consent is required due to anonymization and the absence of cookies.</p>
  <p><strong>No merging:</strong> No linkage with other services or personal data.</p>
  <p><strong>Storage duration:</strong> Aggregated statistical data are retained permanently or until manual deletion to identify trends; any short-term raw data (e.g., for anti-abuse) are processed by GoatCounter only as long as needed for aggregation (see GoatCounter privacy notes).</p>
  <p><strong>Opt-out / Do Not Track:</strong> If your browser sends "Do Not Track" (DNT), the visit is not counted. More information: <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> No cookies; if optional, consent-required features are enabled in the future, this section will be updated.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>No non-essential cookies are currently set. Reach measurement with GoatCounter takes place without cookies. Browser settings (e.g., Do Not Track) are respected. Should functional or convenience cookies be introduced in the future, this section will be updated; in that case, you would be informed and — where required — asked for consent.</p>

    <h2>6. Overview of Legal Bases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR — Provision of the website / security (server logs)</li>
      <li>Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR — Web analytics (Google Analytics)</li>
      <li>Art. 6(1)(f) or (b) GDPR — Communication by email (interest or pre-contractual)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Recipients / Categories of Recipients</h2>
    <p>Hosting provider (technical delivery), Google Ireland Limited (web analytics, if consented), and, where applicable, Google LLC (USA) in the context of data transfers.</p>

    <h2>8. Storage Duration / Deletion</h2>
    <p>Personal data are deleted or anonymized as soon as the respective purpose ceases to apply or statutory retention periods expire.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Server log files (GitHub Pages):</strong> Processing and deletion according to the hosting provider’s internal policies (see GitHub Privacy Statement); no permanent storage by me.</li>
      <li><strong>GoatCounter statistical data:</strong> Only aggregated, non-personal counts are retained for the longer term; no personal profiles.</li>
      <li><strong>Email correspondence:</strong> Deletion after completion of communication or periodic review, unless statutory retention obligations conflict.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access (Art. 15), rectification (Art. 16), erasure (Art. 17), restriction (Art. 18), data portability (Art. 20), objection to certain processing (Art. 21), and withdrawal of consent given (Art. 7(3)) with effect for the future. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR).</p>

    <h2>10. Obligation to Provide</h2>
    <p>You are not legally required to provide your data for merely visiting the website. However, without processing server log data, stable operation is not technically possible. The use of Google Analytics is entirely voluntary.</p>

    <h2>11. Automated Decision-Making / Profiling</h2>
    <p>No automated decision-making or profiling within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR takes place.</p>
